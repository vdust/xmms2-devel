.SH NAME
xmms2 \- The official XMMS2 command line interface
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xmms2
[command]
[arguments]
.br
.B xmms2 help
[command]
.SH DESCRIPTION
XMMS2 is a redesign of the XMMS (http://legacy.xmms2.org) music player. It features a client-server model, allowing multiple (even simultaneous!) user interfaces, both textual and graphical. All common audio formats are supported using plugins. On top of this, there is a flexible media library to organise your music.
.PP
.B xmms2
is the official CLI XMMS2 client.
.SH INVOCATION
.SS Inline mode
If
.B xmms2
is passed a command as an argument, that command will be interpreted and
.B xmms2
will exit after it is finished.
.SS Interactive mode
.B xmms2
features a powerful shell-like environment via readline that allows the user to
enter commands at a prompt and have the usual cool features such as pathname
expansion and line editing.
.SH COMMANDS
.PP
All commands accept the option \fB\-h\fR/\fB\-\-help\fR which displays the command's help.
.PP
\fIpattern\fR refers to a collection definition. (See \fBPATTERN\fR below.)
.PP
\fIposition\fR is a pattern to match playlist positions. When absent in a command, the default is the end of the playlist. (See \fBPOSITION PATTERN\fR below.)
.SS General Commands
\fBadd\fR [ \fB\-f\fR [\fB\-N\fR] [\fB\-P\fR] [\fB\-A\fR \fIkey=value\fR]... ] [\fB\-p\fR \fIplaylist\fR] [\fB\-n\fR | \fB\-a\fR \fIposition\fR] [\fB-o\fR \fIprop\fR[,...]] [\fB-j\fR] \fIarguments\fR...

.PP
.RS 4
Add media to a playlist. It will attempt to guess whether \fIarguments\fR
constitute a \fIpattern\fR or represent file paths. This behaviour can be overridden by
forcing the type with \fB-f\fR and \fB-t\fR. If file paths contain * or ?
characters, it will attempt to expand them. Failing to find a match the * and ? characters
will be attempted to be added as a part of the URL.
